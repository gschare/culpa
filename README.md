# CURIE: Columbia Unofficial Repository of Instructor Evaluations

## What?
**[Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/)**, mainly aiming towards undergraduates in Barnard, Columbia College, and SEAS.

**Unofficial**, as in no affiliation with the university faculty, administration, or staff.

**Repository**, as in one central place to find and provide information, and also as in a public GitHub repository.

**Instructor**, as in teacher of college classes.

**Evaluations**, as in written reviews of a particular class with a particular professor, based on first-hand experience, so that others may benefit from the wisdom of their peers.

## Why?
This site is inspired by the late CULPA (Columbia Underground Listing of Professor Ability), which served the Columbia community high-quality and easily-available professor reviews for more than a decade. Unfortunately, it stopped being maintained and numerous alternate versions popped up. **This particular incarnation aims to carry on CULPA's original mission in spirit and promote its long-term sustainability through this _public_, _open-source_, _low-tech_ website.**

## What about...

### ...the original CULPA at culpa.info?
I have no idea. I tried contacting them and got no reply. Their website has not been updated in a year.

### ...the nasty things said in these old reviews?
I am not personally responsible for the content of reviews submitted prior to Summer 2022. These were sourced from the original CULPA and represent a corpus far too large to vet, numbering over 25,000 dating back over a decade.

### ...the nasty things said in these new reviews?
Get in contact and I'll take a look.

## How?
JSON data, HTML templates written in the Pandoc templating language, and a Haskell script that generates a static website hosted by GitHub pages. New reviews submitted via Google Sheets and processed manually.

## When?
